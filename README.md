CMSC 341 Data Structures project -- AVL Trees

This project implements AVL Trees, a type of binary search trees that requires the two child nodes of a root node to maintain a height difference not exceeding one. If a height imbalance occurs, the structure will perform rotations to balance the tree.

Some code was provided and required modification by students. The AVLForest header and cpp files were provided as skeleton files and were changed to fit our AVL tree implementation. The AVLTreeBase.h file was provided and could not be modified. It was used for inheritance. Full project specifications can be found in CMSC341Project3.pdf.

proj3 is intended to be run from the command line using the 'make run' command.
Example: make run INPUT=input1.txt RANGE=range1.txt

My project received a grade of 100%.
